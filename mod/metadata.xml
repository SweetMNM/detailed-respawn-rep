    Detailed Respawn updated for repentance! For the ab+ version go to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2094114939

    [url=https://github.com/SweetMNM/detailed-respawn-rep]Source Code[/url]

    Detailed Respawn lets you know what respawns you have in the correct order they will activate. It also shows you how many lives you have left from 9 lives and the chances of respawning for respawns based on chance (Guppy's Collar and Broken Ankh).

    You can customize the mod using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818]Mod Config Menu Continued[/url].

    [h1][b]Features:[/b][/h1]
    - Alternative icons showing the character instead of the item icon (Dark Judas instead of Judas' Shadow)
    - Option to only show next respawn (Only show the next respawn that is going to activate to avoid HUD clutter)
    - Option to hide the Detailed Respawn hud on curse of the unknown (if that's your thing)
    - Option to hide additional text like 9 lives amount and Guppy's Collar chances
    - Customize the icons and text size
    - Control the transperancy of the hud
    - Mods with custom respawns can add compatibility with Detailed Respawn

    [h1][b]Planned Features:[/b][/h1]
    - co-op support, currently it will only show for 1 player :(
    - Anything you want! Just ask in the comments
